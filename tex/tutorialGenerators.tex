\begin{slide}{Introduction}
\null\vfill

  \begin{itemize}
   
    \item Each neutrino MC event generator performs simulations in two steps:
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item cross section calculation
      \item event generation
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Usually, two output files are produced:
    
    \begin{itemize}
     \item cross section per channel (sometimes as a function of energy - GENIE, sometimes integrated over flux - NuWro)
     \item ROOT file with TTree of events
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item During tutorial we are going to work with GENIE's gst files (as they required only ROOT)
    
    \item You can find them here: \href{http://home.fnal.gov/~goran/NUSTEC_tutorial/}{[gst files]}
    
  \end{itemize}
